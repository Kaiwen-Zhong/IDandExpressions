Person and Emotion Recognition
In this project, a model was developed and tested to
recognize emotional expressions and different people from self- taken mobile phone pictures. 
The stages in the process are fourfold: 
1) data generation using phone camera, 
2) data pre-processing in MATLAB, 
3) feature extraction in MATLAB and 
4) the application of supervised machine learning models using Weka.
